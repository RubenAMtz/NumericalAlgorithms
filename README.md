# Numerical Algorithms

Basic numerical algorithms developed in Matlab 2018b.

## Try it yourself:

Requirements

Matlab 2018b

## Install
$git clone https://github.com/RubenAMtz/NumericalAlgorithms/

# Demo

Once you have your files in your local computer, open Matlab and set the working directory were the repo files are.  
To run the demo go to ./demo and open file DrEqn.m and run it. It will display the results from 12 different functions.

### FUN
The file FUN.m stores the functions to be tested

### DFUN
The contains the derivative of those functions, the newton raphson algorithm requires it.

### GetDat
It is in charge of calling and set the test conditions per function and method.
